## Q3 2025: AI-Powered Revenue Cycle Management

Building on our AI foundation and front desk automation, we want to revolutionizing how
practices handle insurance billing. By connecting every patient interaction with
intelligent billing processes, we're solving the fundamental issues that have
plagued medical billing for decades.

### Intelligent Insurance Processing

Our AI analyzes every patient interaction to ensure accurate billing from the start.
The system continuously monitors patient interactions, automatically verifying and
updating insurance information in real-time during scheduling and registration.
When discrepancies are found in demographics or coverage details, the AI
proactively flags and corrects these issues before they impact billing. This
constant verification process ensures that your practice always has the most
up-to-date and accurate patient information.

### AI-Enhanced Medical Coding

Gone are the days of piecing together billing information from scattered sources.
Our AI system now intelligently analyzes all patient interactions - from front
desk communications to clinical notes - to build a complete picture of each
visit. It identifies billable interactions automatically and suggests appropriate
codes based on the full context of patient care. The system learns from your
coding patterns over time, becoming more accurate and aligned with your practice's
specific needs.

### Predictive Claim Management

We're introducing a proactive approach to claim management that stops denials
before they happen. Our AI reviews claims before submission, checking for
missing information, compliance issues, and other common denial triggers. Using
patterns learned from millions of claims, it predicts potential issues and
suggests specific corrections to maximize acceptance rates. This predictive
approach dramatically reduces denial rates and accelerates reimbursement times.

<Info>
  By connecting front desk AI with billing processes, we're creating a system
  that captures and verifies critical information at every step, dramatically
  reducing the errors and delays that typically plague insurance billing.

<Note>
  This roadmap represents our planned features and improvements. Timing and
  specific features may evolve based on customer feedback and industry needs.
