### A Fresh New Look 🎨

We've completely redesigned the Decoda Health Platform to make your daily workflows smoother and more intuitive. The new design features a modern color scheme, improved readability, and a more organized layout that helps you find what you need faster.

### Simplified Navigation 🧭

Finding your way around is now easier than ever. We've reorganized the platform into clear categories:

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Communications Hub">
      All patient communication tools are now centralized under the Communications tab. This includes chat and calling features for direct patient interactions.

      <Note>
        **Coming soon:** We're building a unified inbox to streamline all patient communications in one place, along with powerful bulk messaging capabilities to help you engage with your patient base more efficiently.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Check-in Central">
      Everything you need for patient check-in, including calendar and forms

      <Note>
        **Coming soon:** We're building a drag-and-drop interface on the calendar and a dashboard overview to help you track and manage upcoming patient appointments more efficiently.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Streamlined Billing">
      Quick access to charges, invoices, payments, and the payment terminal are in their own dedicated sections instead of being under different tabs.
    </Accordion>

  </AccordionGroup>

### Find Your Way Faster 🎯

The new search feature now includes breadcrumb navigation, making it simpler to understand where you are in the platform. We've also improved the profile menu to make managing your account and tenant information more straightforward.

### Profile Menu Simplified 🔍

We've repositioned the settings and usage pages. If you are a client with multiple tenants, you can now switch between them in the profile menu.

### Powerful Command Menu 🔍

Our new command menu is your command center for quick navigation and search. Just press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) from anywhere in the platform to:

- Jump to any page or feature instantly
- Search through patient records quickly
- Get smart suggestions based on your recent activity
- Find specific content within the current page

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) anywhere in the platform
  to quickly search and navigate to any feature.

<Note>
  **Coming soon:** Soon, you'll be able to ask the Decoda Platform to do tasks
  for you, like "Show me all the patients I have appointments with next week" or
  "Find me all the patients who haven't filled out a form this month."
</Note>

### Important URL Changes ⚠️

<Warning>
  If you have bookmarked any pages in the platform, you'll need to update them. We've reorganized the following URLs:

- Chat and Call pages moved to `/comms/chat` and `/comms/call`
- Dashboard (home screen) moved to `/billing/dashboard`
- Forms and Calendar moved to `/check-in/forms` and `/check-in/calendar`
- Billing tabs are now separate pages under `/billing/`
- Settings pages are now under `/settings/`

Please update your bookmarks to ensure continued quick access to your frequently used pages.

</Warning>
