## Invoicing Workflow

The typical invoicing workflow in Decoda Health follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invoice Creation">
    Invoices are generated either automatically or manually by staff in the
    payment terminal by creating an outstanding charge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Invoices are delivered to patients through the assigned communication
    channel. With smart fallbacks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Collection">
    Payments are processed and applied to outstanding balances. Invoices are
    automatically updated to reflect the new balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each invoice set in the system progresses through various statuses as it moves through the collection process:

1. **Active** - The invoice set is active and healthy. Invoices are being sent.
2. **Paused** - Collection process temporarily halted
3. **Cancelled** - Invoice set has been cancelled
4. **Expired** - Invoice set has reached the end of its collection period
5. **Paid** - Fully paid by the patient
6. **Will Fail** - System has detected issues that will prevent successful delivery of one or more invoices in the future
7. **Failed** - Collection process has failed due to technical or other issues

Users can perform several actions on entire sets of invoices:

- Resume a paused invoice set
- Pause an active invoice set
- Change the rule set applied to an invoice
- Send to collections agency
- Write off the balance
- Cancel the invoice set

## Rule Sets

Rule sets are the core of Decoda's intelligent invoicing system. They define:

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timing">
    When initial invoices and follow-up reminders will be sent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalation">
    How to escalate collection efforts for unpaid invoices
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content">
    What messaging and formatting will be used in communications
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managed Patient Payments

Decoda's intelligent invoicing system handles the entire payment lifecycle automatically, allowing you to focus on patient care while we handle collections:

- **Automated Patient Inquiries**: Our system automatically responds to patient questions about their bills, payment options, and due dates without staff intervention
- **Smart Balance Extraction**: The platform automatically extracts due amounts from your practice management system, ensuring accuracy and eliminating manual data entry
- **End-to-End Invoice Management**: From initial bill creation to final payment confirmation, the entire invoicing cycle is managed automatically
- **Multi-Channel Communications**: Patients receive timely reminders through their preferred channels (email, SMS, mail) based on your configured rule sets
- **Self-Service Payment Options**: Patients can easily pay online, set up payment plans, or schedule future payments without calling your office

Simply set up your rules once, and the system handles everything else - you just watch the payments come in.

<Note>
  Custom integrations can be developed using our comprehensive API.
  Alternatively, we offer a managed human in the loop service for those who
  prefer to handle payments manually.
