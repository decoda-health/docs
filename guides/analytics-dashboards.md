## Tips for Effective Analytics

### Focus on Key Metrics

Don't track everything. Choose 5-10 metrics that:
- Directly impact your business
- You can act on
- Align with goals

Example for aesthetic clinic:
1. Daily revenue
2. New patients
3. No-show rate
4. Average transaction value
5. Patient retention

### Review Regularly

- Daily: Revenue, appointments, no-shows
- Weekly: Staffing metrics, outstanding balance
- Monthly: Retention, profitability, trends
- Quarterly: Year-over-year comparisons

### Act on Insights

Data only matters if you change behavior:

"No-show rate is 15%" → Implement reminder SMS → Rate drops to 8%

"Revenue down 20%" → Analyze by service → Promote underperforming service

### Create Goals

Set targets and track progress:
- Increase daily revenue 10%
- Reduce no-show rate to under 10%
- Achieve 80% patient retention
- Add 5 new patients per week

Monitor actual vs. goal in dashboards.
