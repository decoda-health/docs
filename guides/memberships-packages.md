# Memberships & Packages Guide

Offer subscriptions and bundled services that increase patient loyalty and revenue. This guide covers creating memberships, selling packages, and tracking usage.

## Understanding Memberships vs. Packages

**Memberships:**
- Recurring charges (monthly or annual)
- Ongoing commitment from patient
- Usually includes multiple services
- Example: "VIP Membership" ($99/month for 2 treatments + discounts)

**Packages:**
- One-time purchase of multiple items
- Patient uses until depleted
- No recurring charge
- Example: "6-Pack Facial Treatments" ($450 for 6 facials)

Both drive revenue and improve retention, but work differently.
