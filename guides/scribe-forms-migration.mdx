title: "Scribe Forms Update"
---

We changed how note templates work. Instead of one big text box, templates now have individual fields for each piece of information—like a form.

**Rolling out January 2026.**

---

## What Changed?

**Old way:** Your template was a block of text with placeholders like `{{chief_complaint}}`. AI filled it in as paragraphs.

**New way:** Your template is a form with separate fields. Each piece of info gets its own box—text fields, dropdowns, yes/no switches, etc.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Before" icon="xmark">
    <ul>
      <li>Hunt through paragraphs to fix one thing</li>
      <li>Vitals buried in text</li>
      <li>AI guesses what goes where</li>
      <li>One big text blob</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="After" icon="check">
    <ul>
      <li>Click the field, edit it, done</li>
      <li>Vitals auto-save to patient chart</li>
      <li>AI knows exactly what each field needs</li>
      <li>Clean, organized sections</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Building a Template

Go to **Settings → Note Templates → Create Template**.

You'll see a blank form on the right and a toolbox on the left.

### Field Types

Drag fields from the left panel onto your template:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Fields" defaultOpen>
    - **Short Text** — One-line answers (chief complaint, diagnosis)
    - **Long Text** — Multi-line answers (assessment, detailed history)
    - **Number** — Just numbers (age, dosage)
    - **Date** — Date picker
    - **Dropdown** — Pick one option from a list
    - **Checkboxes** — Pick multiple options
    - **Yes/No** — Simple toggle switch
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Patient Chart Fields">
    These have a green dot and auto-save to the patient record:
    - Weight, Height, Blood Pressure
    - Allergies, Medications
    - Medical History
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attachments (Photos)">
    Upload slots for images (before/after photos, etc.)

    Attachments work the same as before—you're still uploading photos the same way. The only difference is where they live. Previously, attachments were in a separate tab. Now you can place them anywhere in your template, right next to the relevant fields.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setting Up a Field

Click any field to configure it:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Label** | The question text ("Chief Complaint") |
| **Required** | Must be filled before saving |
| **AI Hint** | Helps AI know what to extract from recordings |
| **Placeholder** | Gray hint text inside empty fields |

<Tip>
**AI Hint example:** If your label is "Subjective", add a hint like "Patient's symptoms and complaints in their own words." This helps AI pull the right info from transcripts.
</Tip>

### Organizing Fields

- **Drag** the handle to reorder
- **Click** to edit
- **Trash icon** to delete

### Provider Access

Control which providers can use this template:

1. Click **Provider Access** in the sidebar
2. Select providers by name or location
3. Use "All" or "None" for quick selection

## Converting Old Templates

Your existing templates still work. We converted them to a single "Long Text" field with your old content.

**Want to upgrade?** You can convert them to the new format:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Template">
    Open your template in **Settings → Note Templates**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Banner">
    Look for the blue **"Legacy Template Detected"** banner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert">
    Click **Convert to Structured Form**—AI suggests fields based on your old template
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Apply">
    Review the suggestions and click **Apply** if you're happy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save your template
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Not sure?** Duplicate your template first. Then you have a backup if you want to revert.
</Note>

## Your Old Notes Are Fine

<Info>
Notes you already created haven't changed. They look exactly the same as before. The new format only applies to new notes going forward.
