# Quickstart

Decoda Health reimagines how practices manage conversations with patients about payments in a respectful and explainable way. Our mission is to enable practices to abstract away the process and infrastructure of managing patient payments entirely.

Using our API your team can:

**Manage Payments**

- Collect patient payments online (via payment links and virtual terminals) and in-person (using card terminals), centralizing all payment sources into one system.
- Support all payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, ACH/eCheck, HSA/FSA, Gift Cards, and Apple Pay.
- Handle major payment workflows like refunds, adjustments, write-offs, discounts, payment plans, external settlements, storing cards on file, and placing holds on cards.

**Manage Conversations**

- Facilitate conversations with patients through two-way texting, inbound and outbound calling, and one-click physical mailing.
- Automatically transcribe, record, and summarize phone conversations in the Web App, providing full context on the conversation history with patients.

**Automated Balance Aging**

- Assign every patient bill to a unique ruleset defining the cadence and medium of each touchpoint. For example, send a text on day 0, send another text on day 10, send physical mail on day 20 and charge the card on file on day 30.
- Configure outreach schedules in Decoda's Web App, allowing the system to determine the best schedule.

### Accept online payments

- When patient responsibility is finalized with adjustments after insurance processes a claim, use Decoda's API to start aging that balance.
- Once a payment ismade a Payment is created and attached to the Charge.

### **Accept In-Person Payments (coming soon)**

- For in-person payments at the card terminal, use Decoda's API to create the charge and then present that charge using Decoda's Web App on the card terminal
- Once a payment is successfully made a Payment is created and attached to the Charge.

### Authentication

To authenticate with the Decoda Health API, include the `API-KEY` and `TENANT` headers in your requests to `https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/`, like so:

<CodeGroup>

```bash auth.sh
curl -X GET "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "TENANT: YOUR_TENANT"
```

```python auth.py
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/healthz",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", "TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT"}
)
```

```javascript auth.ts
import ky from "ky";

const response = ky.get("https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/...", {
  headers: {
    API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    TENANT: "YOUR_TENANT",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. If you don't have one, request one from [Decoda Health Support](https://decodahealth.com/contact-us).

**Ensure that your API key is secure and not shared publicly.**
