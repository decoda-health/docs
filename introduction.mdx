# Quickstart

### Base URL

All HTTP requests should be made to:

```
https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/
```

### Authentication

To authenticate with the Decoda Health API, include the `X-API-KEY` and `X-TENANT` headers in your requests to `https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/`, like so:

<CodeGroup>

```bash list_patients.sh
curl -X GET "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/healthz" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "X-TENANT: YOUR_TENANT"
```

```python list_patients.py
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/healthz",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", "X-TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT"}
)
```

```javascript list_patients.ts
import ky from "ky";

const response = ky.get("https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/healthz", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "X-TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. If you don't have one, request one from [Decoda Health Support](https://decodahealth.com/contact-us).

**Ensure that your API key is secure and not shared publicly.**
