## Getting Started

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.decodahealth.com
```

### Authentication

The Decoda Health API uses API key authentication. Include the following headers in every request:

- `API-KEY`: Your API key (obtained from Decoda Health)
- `TENANT`: Your tenant identifier

<CodeGroup>

```bash auth.sh
curl -X GET "https://api.decodahealth.com/tenant/public" \
     -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "TENANT: YOUR_TENANT"
```

```python auth.py
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.decodahealth.com/tenant/public",
    headers={
        "API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT"
    }
)
```

```typescript auth.ts
import ky from "ky";

const response = await ky.get("https://api.decodahealth.com/tenant/public", {
  headers: {
    "API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Getting Your API Key

If you don't have an API key, contact [Decoda Health Support](mailto:support@decodahealth.com) to request access.

**Security Best Practices**

- Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables to store API keys securely
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts for unusual activity

## API Versioning

The Decoda Health API follows semantic versioning. The current API version is **v1**. We maintain backward compatibility within major versions and will provide advance notice for any breaking changes.

## Rate Limits

API rate limits are applied per tenant to ensure fair usage. Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

If you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff when retrying requests.

## Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications about events in your Decoda Health account by configuring webhooks. See the [Webhook documentation](/api-reference/webhook) for details on setting up and managing webhooks.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- `2xx`: Success
- `4xx`: Client error (invalid request, authentication failure, etc.)
- `5xx`: Server error

Error responses include a JSON body with details about what went wrong:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```
