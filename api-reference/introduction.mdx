### Authentication

To authenticate with the Decoda Health API, include the `API-KEY` and `TENANT` headers in your requests:

<CodeGroup>

```bash auth.sh
curl -X GET "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/" \
     -H "API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "TENANT: YOUR_TENANT"
```

```python auth.py
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/healthz",
    headers={"API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY", "TENANT": "YOUR_TENANT"}
)
```

```typescript auth.ts
import ky from "ky";

const response = await ky.get("https://api.decodahealth.com/v1/...", {
  headers: {
    API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    TENANT: "YOUR_TENANT",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. If you don't have one, request one from [Decoda Health Support](https://decodahealth.com).

**Ensure that your API key is secure and not shared publicly.**
