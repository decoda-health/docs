If the device does not power on, ensure the device is fully charged with the USB-C cable provided with the reader. **Note:** On initial start‚Äêup, you must charge the battery for 16 hours.

After the device is powered on and if it displays a **Cloud / Disconnected** message, please continue with Step 2.

If the reader displays the Serial Number, Unregistered, and a Registration Code, this indicates your device is already configured and you can skip to Step 7.

### Step 2: Access the Admin Menu

Using the reader PIN pad, enter `0001`. This will take you to the Admin Menu.

### Step 3: Set Communication Type

Using the **F2** and **F3** function keys to scroll, select option `1 - Communication Type` then within that menu, select option `4 - WIFI`. Navigate back to the Admin Menu using the **Yellow back button**.

### Step 4: Configure WIFI Parameters

In the Admin Menu, select option `2 - WIFI Parameters`, then in that menu, select option `2 - Scan Networks` to search for networks nearby. Once the scan is completed, you will see a list of networks available.

### Step 5: Connect to a Network

Select the network you wish to configure your device with and enter the network password if requested. Once connected, you will see a **New Profile OK** message and return back to the Admin Menu.

To confirm if the device is connected to the network you previously selected, navigate to option `2 - Wi-Fi Parameters` in the Admin Menu, then option `3 - My networks`. Here, you will find a list of all previously saved networks. If the previously selected network is online, the word **connected** will be under the network name.

### Step 6: Exit the Admin Menu

You can exit the Admin Menu by using the back (**Yellow** button) or using the cancel (**Red** button).

If this is the first time setting up the device with a Wifi network or a code is not shown on the device, you may need to restart the device:
To force restart the device hold the `-` button (left of the Green button) and the Yellow button (above the Green button) at the same time until the 'Shutdown In Progress' screen is shown (about one second).
You will need to power the reader again by following Step 1.

### Step 7: Registration Code

When connected, the WiFi symbol will show connected and green on the top left. The code displayed on the screen is the Registration Code required for this step.

Follow the steps as per your platform when instructed to provide a registration code.
