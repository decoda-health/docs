# Alerts

Alerts help you stay on top of things that need attention - like missed appointments, failed payments, or incomplete forms. Think of it as your practice's to-do list that updates automatically.

## What Are Alerts?

Alerts are automatic notifications about situations that might need your attention:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Appointment Issues" icon="calendar-xmark">
    - Patient no-shows
    - Scheduling conflicts
    - Missing appointment information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payment Problems" icon="credit-card">
    - Failed payment attempts
    - Overdue invoices
    - Payment plan issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Form Reminders" icon="file-circle-exclamation">
    - Incomplete intake forms
    - Missing signatures
    - Expired consents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inventory Warnings" icon="box-open">
    - Low stock items
    - Expiring products
    - Reorder reminders
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Viewing Your Alerts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Alerts">
    Click **Alerts** in the main menu (or look for the bell icon)
  </Step>
  <Step title="See what needs attention">
    Alerts are organized by category with counts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter if needed">
    Use the filters to focus on specific types or time periods
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Alert Categories

At the top of the page, you'll see cards showing counts for each category. Click a card to filter to just those alerts.

## Taking Action on Alerts

### Viewing Details

Click any alert to see the full story:
- What happened
- Which patient or appointment it relates to
- When it occurred
- Who it's assigned to (if anyone)

### Resolving Alerts

When you've handled something, mark it as resolved:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the alert">
    Opens the details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Resolve">
    Usually a checkmark button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    The alert is marked complete and won't appear in your action-needed list
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Assigning to a Team Member

Need someone else to handle it?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the alert">
    Click to view details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Assign">
    Choose a team member from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="They're notified">
    The alert appears in their queue
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Assign alerts to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. Each team member can filter to see just their assigned tasks.
</Tip>

## Filtering Alerts

### By Time
Choose how far back to look: last 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, or pick custom dates.

### By Category
Click a category card at the top, or use the filter dropdown to select specific types.

### By Status
Toggle **Action Required** to hide alerts you've already resolved.

### By Person
Select **Assigned to Me** to see only your tasks, or choose a specific team member.

## Alert Priority Levels

| Priority | What it means | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **High** | Needs immediate attention | Failed payments, double bookings |
| **Medium** | Should handle soon | No-shows, insurance issues |
| **Low** | Good to know | Incomplete forms, low stock |

    Yes, alert settings can be configured in Settings. Talk to your administrator about which alerts your practice wants to track.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I resolve an alert?">
    It's marked as handled and won't appear in your action-needed list. You can still see resolved alerts by turning off the "Action Required" filter.
