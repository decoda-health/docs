## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find a patient | Try searching by phone number - it's often more reliable than name spelling |
| Can't edit information | You may not have permission - check with your administrator |
| Forms not showing | Make sure the form was submitted, not just opened by the patient |
| Photos not uploading | Check the file size - very large images may need to be resized first |
