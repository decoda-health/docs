# Shopping Carts

Shopping carts let you gather services and products for a patient before processing payment. Think of it like an online shopping cart - you add items, review the total, and then check out when ready.

## Understanding Cart Status

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress - you can still edit this cart |
| **Accepted** | Patient accepted the quote you sent |
| **Rejected** | Patient declined the quote |
| **Converted** | Cart was checked out and payment was processed |
| **Abandoned** | Cart was inactive for too long |
| **Expired** | The cart or quote passed its expiration date |

<Warning>
You can only edit carts that are in **Draft** status. Once a cart is converted to a charge or a quote is sent, you'll need to create a new cart for changes.
</Warning>

## Common Questions

    Carts remain available until they're converted to a charge, expire, or are deleted. You can set expiration dates when creating quotes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit a cart after sending a quote?">
    No, once a quote is sent, the cart is locked. If you need to change pricing, create a new cart and send a new quote.

  <Accordion title="What happens to unused carts?">
    Carts that remain inactive for an extended period are automatically marked as abandoned. You can still access them but may want to review if the items and pricing are still current.
